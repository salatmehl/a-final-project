# a-final-project
This is a webpage used to build a website for the bootcamp's final project (Digital Marketing Analytics).

The website's structure is based on the scenario below. 

<b>Setup:</b>
We are a XYZ School, an education provider in Berlin. Since many students have transfered their studies online and now join remotely, we donâ€™t have anyone to study in our classrooms. As a result we have XYZ classrooms staying empty in our 3 locations across the country. Our idea is to build a booking platform webpage that offers those workspaces to digital workers in need of modern offices. Interested parties can book offices on a daily basis + as an individual or company. The main interest is growing the revenue solely online from this renting-out-model by XYZ% by the end of 6 / 12 months.
